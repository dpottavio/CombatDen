Combat Den is an open source project to provide simple randomized
missions for single and mulitplayer environments for Arma 3.

briefing.  Just play.

to see, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/dpottavio/CombatDen/issues) and describe in

to complete.  The best way to expedite this process is to make the
change yourself and make a Pull-Request to the project.  Pull-Requests
